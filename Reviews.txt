Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of testing out the Boat Air Dopes Bluetooth headset, and I must say, Iâ€™m thoroughly impressed. From its build quality to its performance, this device exceeded my expectations in many ways.
|
Letâ€™s start with the basics: sound quality. The Boat Air Dopes deliver crisp, clear sound with rich bass that truly elevates the listening experience. Whether Iâ€™m jamming out to my favorite tunes or taking calls on the go, the audio quality never disappoints. The clarity and depth of sound are simply remarkable, especially considering the price point of these earbuds.
|
Connectivity is another area where the Boat Air Dopes shine. Pairing them with my Android device was a breeze, and the connection has been rock solid ever since. Even when I tested them with my iPhone, I was pleasantly surprised by how well they performed. While there may be a slight lag compared to pricier alternatives like AirPods, itâ€™s hardly noticeable in everyday use. Plus, the extended Bluetooth range means I can roam freely without worrying about losing connection.
|
Battery life is always a concern with wireless earbuds, but the Boat Air Dopes deliver impressive longevity. I can go hours without needing to recharge, making them perfect for long commutes, workouts, or just daily use. And when itâ€™s time to juice them up, the included charging case makes it quick and convenient.
|
One feature that truly sets the Boat Air Dopes apart is their design. Sleek and stylish, these earbuds not only look great but also fit comfortably in my ears. The ergonomic design ensures a snug fit, so they stay put no matter how active I am. Plus, theyâ€™re lightweight and discreet, making them ideal for wearing on the go.
|
Overall, I canâ€™t recommend the Boat Air Dopes enough. Whether youâ€™re an Android user looking for top-notch performance or an iPhone user in search of a more budget-friendly option, these earbuds have you covered. With their superb sound quality, reliable connectivity, and impressive battery life, theyâ€™re a solid choice for anyone in the market for a new Bluetooth headset. Trust me, you wonâ€™t be disappointed.

Don't buy, is wasting your money there is only 7 day return policy and after finishing this period, i had a problem with Mic quality problem " is entrapped with wind voice brake"
My suggestion is do not buy i waste my money

The audio quality is fine for the price. They're heavily tuned out of the box with no way to tune it yourself. No app connectivity. You're left with two default EQ presets that you can change with touch controls.
The noise suppression is too aggressive and the mic doesn't sound that great. But it's fine for this price range and it suppresses and good amount of noise. Good for calls but nor for meetings or anything that demands quality.
Touch controls are horrible on these headphones to a point I wish there was just an option to just turn them off. I almost always trigger them when I take them out of the case. It almost never activates properly when I actually want it to or you have to keep retrying. The touch and hold actions don't always trigger and you lift your finger only to find out it recognized what you did as a touch action and pauses/plays.
|
Why is ambient mode the first option when tapping and holding on right earbud for 3 seconds? Why isn't it ANC? These earbuds are advertised as ANC earbuds, so maybe the people who buy these want to activate the ANC mode more quickly and not the ambient mode? The controls are poorly thought out.
Why doesn't these earbuds remember the mode I selected? Why do I have to cycle through normal mode and ambient mode just to activate ANC? This is horrible user experience.
Honestly, if I knew it was this bad, I wouldn't buy these. You won't find these annoying until you have used these for a while and by then, the return window would close.

If you care about the things I mentioned above, please don't buy these earbuds.

Best ANC Buds in this price range its performance and battery life is more than i expected it tooks full charge for 2 hour and the buds runs 6 to 7 days i likes its mic quality , performance, stability , comfortable .
|
Great product except that sometimes the sound comes after a long pause as I connect it to my smart TV.
|
Itâ€™s genuine review after using it for a week. These earpods are same as Rs 50 railway station earphones. Very poor sound, hurts in your ear.
I would recommend to wait and add 1-2k more to your bugdet and buy something better or try another brand.
I bought 2 pods from boat both are same. Have put 1300 and 1700 = 3k for both and I regret.
ANC is a scam here.
|
Earbuds quality, sound quality and case quality is too good.
But, once it fall down, everything will change drastically.
Loose drivers, disgusting sound occurs.
And software issues like, microphone problem when we make a call and left and right buds sync issues when we change modes.
|
Guys don't purchase this product it is worst.
I tried so many times for return. Amazon blocked return option they doing scam.
Don't purchase anything. Even I messaged to agent they didn't took actions ðŸ˜•

NIBOSI ANALOG WATCH

Very bad product does nt work at all poor condition
|
This looks good but none of the special dials work except the main one..
|
I bought it but it had stopped working after few days . so i won't recommend this product.
|
The watch looked nice in Amazon app photos but it looks brilliantly attractive in real. All the chronograph registers are working. I still don't know how it's chronograph works, but its working fine. Happy.
|
DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH ITS VERY CHEAP WATCH
|
Customers like the comfort, value, weight and appearance of the watch. For example, they mention it's comfortable, easy to wear, value for money and looks like original casino watches. Some are satisfied with the quality. That said, some complain about the color.

I have purchased this combo watches for fancy use. The look is good (almost similar to Casio W158 A) . The back light is with 4 colors (changeable with press of a button). The performance is also impressive. The only drawback I experienced is the Strap of the watches. They are very thin and not of the quality assured by the vendor. The hooks of the strap are fallen down after 2 time use and I have gone for a replacement of the strap locally. The Rose gold plating was gone by 3 days (in fact 3 times) use. Each time about 3 to 4 hrs I have used this watch. S.Steel watch is OK. Any one who is interested to have fun with change of watches frequently for party purpose can buy these watches and enjoy its performance. If the Company improves a bit in the quality of the straps and Case of the watch it will be the best alternative to the CASIO. Good luck guys.

Pros : Excellent product easy to use , nice display , durable and a very reasonable price with easy going mobile connected app .
Cons : magnetic charger not connected mostly with accuracy , it creates less confidence and sureity that watch had gone charge full .

The Noise ColorFit Pulse 3 boasts a large 1.96" display, but unfortunately, that's where the excitement might end for some users. Here's a closer look:
Impressive Battery Life: The advertised 7-day battery backup seems to hold true, a major plus for those who hate constant charging.
Excellent Call Quality: Both sides of calls come through clearly and loudly, making the built-in calling a valuable feature.
Great Touch Sensitivity: The reviewer mentions smooth touch response, ensuring navigating the watch is a hassle-free experience.
Seamless Notifications: Getting message alerts right on your wrist is a big convenience.

I've just recently gone through six or seven smart watches in order to find the right one that had what I was looking for in it. What I was looking for in my smart watch was to have excellent call, answer features. Meaning that I can hear a conversation on my smart watch without having to hold it to my ear and the other party could hear me without sounding like I'm far away from the phone or have it muffled. The only other thing I was looking for basically in my smart watch would be sleep tracking and step counting. And with this "NOISE" Brand, I've finally found the one for me. I can hear conversations very clearly. Even outside course it cannot be extremely loud, but you can hear better than all the other ones I've tested out. And every conversation that I've had if I asked the other party, if they hear me clearly they definitely can. I do believe this watch also has noise canceling technology. That's definitely a plus. That makes the conversation between you and the other person sound as if you're on a regular house phone. I'm so glad I found this brand.

iphone 15 - 
|
Awesome product very happy to hold this. Better In hand feel,matte finish.
Good camera, Brighter screen with Dynamic Island, USB-C, great battery life.
60Hz display is a dealbreaker for some.Its not much noticeable.
Thank u Flipkart for the best deal and quick delivery.
|
This iPhone 15 feels amazing in my hand. 
The rounded edges are a big improvement over the boxy design of the 14. Plus, 
the matte blue finish is gorgeous and doesn't show fingerprints like crazy. 
The Dynamic Island is also super cool -  it's like having a mini multitasking bar right at the top. 
So far, the battery life seems decent, lasting me a full day on a single charge.
|
 For a phone at this price point, the battery life on the iPhone 15 is a bit underwhelming. 
 I barely make it through a workday on a single charge, and that's with moderate usage. 
 Having to carry a charger around is a bit of a hassle.
