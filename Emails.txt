Subject: Complaint About Defective Product

Dear Customer Support,

I recently purchased a blender (Order #12345) from your online store, and it arrived defective. Upon the first use, the motor made a loud grinding noise and failed to blend the ingredients properly. I followed all the operating instructions carefully, so I am certain the product is faulty.

Could you please provide instructions for returning the product and receiving a refund or replacement? Additionally, I would appreciate any information on how to expedite this process, as I urgently need a functional blender.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
